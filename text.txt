Canon is a term oft-used to refer to official lore, specifically the fictional accounts in the Warcraft universe. It is used to define which lore should be considered a genuine part of the universe's history.

The Warcraft 'canon' comprises those works and sources of information considered to be authoritative and representative of the 'true' or official history of the Warcraft universe. Therefore, 'canon' or 'canonical' lore is that which is part of this body of work, and is thus considered part of the true history of the Warcraft universe.

In contrast, 'non-canon' information, while often containing characters and depicting events from canon sources, is not necessarily a reliable source of official information regarding the Warcraft universe. An example of non-canon lore might be a piece of fan fiction which introduces new characters or events, or expands upon the background of a known character such as Thrall.

Characters, events and items from non-canon sources do not necessarily exist in the official Warcraft universe. Non-canon versions of known events may differ substantially from official sources. Non-canon sources frequently feature characters from canon lore, but their exploits in these sources are not considered canon.

Note that even canon lore is sometimes contradictory (or retconned), often representing the beliefs or perspectives of an individual or group, rather than any absolute truth. Nonetheless, the beliefs themselves can be considered a genuine part of the Warcraft universe as flavor lore, regardless of their accuracy.
